    "Good Choice, my agent… uniting him with his wife would have ended the two timelines. Well, moving on, now we are in the year 3170 CE. The final showdown happens here. ",
    "We need to make sure we get through this one safe and sound. Let me give you a bit of exposition of what Andwyn's plan might be. ",
    "In 3170 CE, after the fall of the UN, the Earth has a central mega-government called The Grand Central Super Secure Facility(GCSSF). The GCSSF is headquartered in Moscow, Russia, one of the safest places in the world. ",
    "The GCSSF has a simple policy. The best way to discourage violence is by having control over the lives of the ones doing all the violence. What that means is that the GCSSF can kill any human as and when they like through a very effortless method. ",
    "They have a vast data-base which has the data of every human being and as soon as someone's data is removed, the certain human being dies. ",
    "This system makes for fair and swift executions and asserts much more authority compared to the weaker UN and hence the GCSSF has been adored by many countries and notable figures throughout history. ",
    "Now, coming back to the mission. I have transported you to two hours before Andwyn reaches here. I need you to infiltrate the GCSSF and set traps for Andwyn before he breaks in and hack into the database to remove his counterpart's data from this timeline. ",
    "Beware, this part is critical and we have to succeed at all costs. If we fail, we not only let the Andwyn of this timeline die, but every person to ever exist in the two timelines. ",
    "Now you will see a dial pad and you have to dial in the right password. Thank you. ",
